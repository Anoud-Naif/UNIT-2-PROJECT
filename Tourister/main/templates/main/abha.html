      <p> Abha is the capital city of the Aseer province near the Red Sea in southwest Saudi Arabia. It is a profoundly cool place with neat green lawns, marigolds, and mountain mist that gives a staggering impression of the city. Due to its geographic location, pleasant weather all year round and being at a high altitude, this city is an adventurous place to visit.


      An Adventurous Place to Visit
      Al Soudah is the spectacular beauty of Abha located on Sirawat Mountain, covered with Araar trees and a natural forest. In addition, the Asir National Park in the Soudah area covers 455,000 hectares which protects both fauna and animals there. It is often possible to see some of Asirâ€™s wild baboons from there.
      
      In particular, Al Muftaha Art Village in the middle of Abha has stone houses and is the perfect place for visitors to find artwork of Saudi painters and sculptors. A weekly market is arranged with crafts, where archaeological items, handicrafts, local honey, hand-woven products and souvenirs are also available.
      
      Souq Basket and Tuesday Market are also well-known places in the city to promote cultural heritage and tradition, where visitors can buy handmade baskets, exquisite antiques and knick-knacks.
      
      More important, at the heart of downtown Abha, the mud-walled Shada Castle was constructed in 1927 that is now turned into a museum displaying household items and local handicrafts to entertain visitors. At the edge of the cliffs, Al Habala Village contains a large area of natural parks of rocky nature, where one can spend the best moments enjoying breathtaking nature.
