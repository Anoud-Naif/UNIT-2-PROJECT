<h2 class="h2-p">About Riyadh</h2>
<p>
  Riyadh is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia. The name Riyadh is derived from the plural of the Arabic word rawdha, which means "garden".
  
  It is situated in the center of the Arabian Peninsula and is home to 4,854,000 people, and the urban center of a region with a population of close to 7 million people.</p>

  <h2 class="h2-p"> Climate </h2>
  <p > Summer temperatures are very hot, approaching 50 degrees Celsius. The average high temperature in July is 43.5Â°C. Winters are mild with cold, windy nights. The overall climate is arid, receiving very little rainfall. It is also known to have many dust storms. The dust is often so thick that visibility is under 10 meters.</p>
  
  <h2 class="h2-p">City Districts</h2> 
  <p >Riyadh is divided into 15 branch municipalities, in addition to the Diplomatic Quarter.
  
  Olaya District is the commercial heart of the city, with accommodation, entertainment, dining and shopping options. The Kingdom Center, Al Faisalyah and Al-Tahlya Street are the area's most prominent landmarks.
  
  The Diplomatic Quarter, or DQ as it is popularly known, is home to foreign embassies and international organizations as well as residential structures and malls. With lush gardens and numerous sports facilities, it is also one of the city's greenest areas. It is especially known for its fine architecture, and is considered a model for other Islamic cities around the world. Despite its name, the special privileges offered in the Diplomatic Quarter constitute a controversial issue. All Saudi laws must be obeyed and there are occasional patrols by the Mutaween, or Saudi religious police. However, foreign diplomats and their families are allowed certain privileges and it is not very uncommon to see foreign diplomats and their wives strolling on the streets of the DQ in shorts and short-sleeve shirts.</p>

  <h4 class="h4-par">Economy</h4>
  <p >Once a small walled city, Riyadh has developed into a dynamic metropolis over the years. Along with the urban areas of Dhahran, Dammam, Khobar and Jeddah, Riyadh has become a focal point for both travel and trade.
  
  In addition to being the center of power, the city is also a commercial hub. Numerous educational, financial, agricultural, cultural, technical, and social organizations have set up base here. The architecture is mostly modern, including contemporary high-rise towers, but the Al-Dira district, the nucleus of the city, has been rebuilt in a style meant to evoke the old mud-brick buildings of pre-20th century Nejd.
  
  King Khalid International Airport has a major impact on the commercial movement in Riyadh, providing air transportation for millions of people each year and shipping goods to the city from all continents. When Sama, an airline, existed, its head office was in Riyadh.
