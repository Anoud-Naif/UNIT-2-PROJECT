<div class="paragraph">
     <p >Al-Khobar city is one of the three main cities in the Eastern Province, the others being Dammam and Dhahran. These three cities form a closely joined triangle which has existed for centuries. 
        In the past, Al-Khobar was a small port on the Arabian Gulf, inhabited mainly by fishermen. With the discovery of oil, it was transformed into an industrial port. In time, it has become the commercial 
        hub of the Eastern Province. Based on a city plan dating back to 1942 (1361H), the city is neatly divided into residential squares evenly transected by roads. Such careful organization is indicative of i
        ts important role in the national economy. Along with its industrial port, the city still serves small ships carrying passengers and goods. It is the center of the area's export-import activity, and is a transit 
        point for goods that are distributed throughout the Kingdom. It contains branches of all the country's major banks as well as fine hotels, some along its picturesque corniche. It is developing into an important 
        industrial city, with factories turning out industrial gas, dairy products, carbonated water, tissue paper and ready-made garments.</p>
        <h3 class="h2-p">King Fahad Causeway</h3>
        <p >
            On the southern outskirts of Al-Khobar passes the King Fahad Causeway which links the Kingdom to Bahrain. Inaugurated in 1986 (1407H), the bridge runs for twenty-five kilometers. Equipped with all necessary facilities, the causeway serves to facilitate the flow of traffic between the two countries and to strengthen relations between them.</p>
            <h3 class="h2-p"> Health Services in Al-Khobar</h3>
            <p>
            The city has numerous hospitals, the most prominent being King Fahad University Hospital (500 beds) and the Al-Khobar General Hospital (50 beds). It is also served by private hospitals, government hospitals and quarantine centers.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h2-p"> Arts and architecture</h3>

<p> The King Fahd Causeway links the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the island nation of Bahrain.
In March 2019, the Sharqiah Season, part of the Saudi Seasons initiative, attracted an estimated 730,000 visitors to multiple cities in the Eastern Province including Khobar under the supervision of the General Authority for Entertainment, with 83 events held across 17 days in 9 cities, celebrating the country's diverse culture, Most notable of the events that took place in Khobar was the Bollywood Festival, designed to attract the city's expatriate majority, featuring Salman Khan.[4][5] Other artists who participated in the Khobar events of the Sharqiah Season include TiÃ«sto and Sean Paul.[6]


The Khobar Water Tower, located on the Khobar Sea Front, is a major tourist attraction.
The Khobar Corniche is a 16-km stretch of parks and a corniche running parallel to the eastern coast of the city along the Persian Gulf and hosting some of the cities most famous attractions. It has been divided into two parts, the South Corniche and the North Corniche. The King Fahd Causeway is a series of causeways and bridges between Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom of Bahrain. The bridge is about 25 kilometers long from the Saudi toll plaza to the Bahraini toll plaza, and 23.2 meters wide. It was officially opened on 25 November 1986 and is named after King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. The bridge has a maximum capacity of 28,000 cars and 1000 trucks. It has achieved many economic and social benefits for both countries.[7][8]

The Khobar Water Tower is situated on a man-made peninsula in the northern reaches of the Khobar Corniche. The Khobar Water Tower is a 90 meter tall, eight-story tower, with a revolving restaurant on the top, overlooking the city. It has been called the Eastern Province's "top tourist attraction".[9] The tower hosts fireworks shows on special occasions such as the arrival of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. The Prince Sultan Science & Technology Center (also known as SciTech) is a science exhibit located directly in view of the Khobar Water Tower and north of the North Corniche of Khobar. The center has five permanent exhibits, known as Scientific Halls, each dedicated to a different branch of science. The center also hosts an IMAX cinema which generally only shows movies that are scientific and/or non-fictional. The center is open every day of the week from 9 am till 9 pm. Except for Friday, where it opens from 4 pm till 9 pm.[10]</p>
